# UltraTuxKart

### Simple 2D racing game made in Java

> I was inspired by SuperTuxKart but this game is completely different.

## So how do you start playing?

First build this project using Gradle and then open the jar file. Make sure to have Java installed, preferably the newest version.
Once you are in the game play the Play button.

## Controls

**WASD keys to control the car, ESC to exit map creator, SPACE to save map and simply left click to replace a tile on the map.**

## Custom maps

Maps should be created in the map creator (to ensure that any errors won't show up). For loading a custom map press Load Map button and select map file with the file explorer.
After loading a map you will be informed if it was loaded successfully. Game will attempt to find path for the bot. If path can't be found bot won't be loaded regardless whether Enable Bot option is activated.
